# Predicate types

Here we define various predicate types as examples to show that decidable predicate types are swappable inside symbolic regular hedge grammars and symbolic regular expressions.

* [AnyEq](./AnyEq.lean) is a simple predicate with only equality and any.
* [Compare](./Compare.lean) is a simple predicate library with only comparisons.
