-- IfExpr represents a nested if expression where each symbol represents a condition and each leaf represents the a combination of booleans.
-- The booleans represent wheher a predicate matched or did not match a symbol on the path to the leaf.
-- This way all possible boolean Vectors are precomputed and heap allocations are avoided outside of the memoized IfExpr.enter.
-- Unfortunately this results in a exponential blowup in memory usage.
-- We provide examples: `example of an IfExpr for two symbols` and `example of evaluating an IfExpr for two symbols`.
-- We prove that evaluating the IfExpr is the same as mapping the predicate over the vector in theorem eval_is_map: (IfExpr.mk xs).eval Φ = Vector.map Φ xs
