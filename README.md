# Verified Derivatives for Fast Filtering and Schema Validation of Semi-Structured Data 

Proofs written in [Lean4](https://leanprover.github.io/) of the core [katydid](http://katydid.org.za/) filtering algorithm for the paper: Verified Derivatives for Fast Filtering and Schema Validation of Semi-Structured Data.

Here we formalize the core of the [Katydid](http://katydid.org.za/) filtering algorithm.
This algorithm allows us to filtering through millions of serialized data structures per second on a single core.
We recommend following the [Readme](./VerifiedFilter/Readme.md) documents, to get an overview of each folder.

## Setup

  - [Install Lean4](https://lean-lang.org/install/).
  - Remember to also add `lake` (the build system for lean) to your `PATH`.  You can do this on mac by adding `export PATH=~/.elan/bin/:${PATH}` to your  `~/.zshrc` file
